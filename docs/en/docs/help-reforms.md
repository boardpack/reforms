# Help Reforms - Get Help

Do you like **Reforms**?

Would you like to help Reforms, other users, and the author?

Or would you like to get help with **Reforms**?

There are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).

And there are several ways to get help too.

## Star **Reforms** in GitHub

You can "star" Reforms in GitHub (clicking the star button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/boardpack/reforms" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/boardpack/reforms</a>. ⭐️

By adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that it has been already useful for others.

## Watch the GitHub repository for releases

You can "watch" Reforms in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/boardpack/reforms" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/boardpack/reforms</a>. 👀

There you can select "Releases only".

Doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of **Reforms** with bug fixes and new features.

## Help others with issues in GitHub

You can see <a href="https://github.com/boardpack/reforms/issues" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing issues</a> and try and help others, most of the times they are questions that you might already know the answer for. 🤓

## Watch the GitHub repository

You can "watch" Reforms in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/boardpack/reforms" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/boardpack/reforms</a>. 👀

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only", you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue.

Then you can try and help them solving those issues.

## Create issues

You can <a href="https://github.com/boardpack/reforms/issues/new/choose" class="external-link" target="_blank">create a new issue</a> in the GitHub repository, for example to:

* Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
* Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you create an issue then I'm going to ask you to also help others. 😉

## Create a Pull Request

You can [contribute](contributing.md){.internal-link target=_blank} to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:

* To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
* To help [translate the documentation](contributing.md#translations){.internal-link target=_blank} to your language.
    * You can also help reviewing the translations created by others.
* To propose new documentation sections.
* To fix an existing issue/bug.
* To add a new feature.

Thanks! 🚀
