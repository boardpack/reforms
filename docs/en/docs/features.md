# Features

## Reforms features

**Reforms** gives you the following:

* Use updated default types like *str*, *bool* etc. and pydantic types like 
*EmailStr* with additional information about HTML rendering.
* Choose one of prepared template packs or create your own.
* Callable-based validators like in [wtforms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/validators/).

## Pydantic features

**Reforms** supports **all** Pydantic features, all fields are inherited from native 
Python or pydantic types, so you can use the same models as before with a new 
opportunity to render it into HTML-layout.
